Your task: Generate search queries to discover automotive dealerships that would be ideal customers for this dealership management system.

Consider:
1. Types of dealerships (franchise, used car, dealer groups)
2. Geographic locations (focus on major markets)
3. Size indicators (multi-location, large operations)
4. Companies likely using legacy systems
5. Companies similar to known DMS users

Generate 8-10 specific, targeted search queries that will help find these potential customers.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this format:
{{
  "queries": [
    "search query 1",
    "search query 2",
    ...
  ],
  "strategy": "Brief explanation of your search strategy"
}}

Make queries specific and actionable. Focus on finding actual company names, not just information about the industry.

Examples of good queries:
- "largest automotive dealership groups United States"
- "top car dealer groups by revenue 2024"
- "multi-location franchise car dealerships"
- "automotive retail chains North America"
- "dealerships similar to AutoNation Penske"
