Your task: Evaluate how good of a customer this company would be for DealerFlow Cloud.

Consider:
1. Is this an automotive dealership or dealer group?
2. Do they likely need modern DMS software?
3. Are they large enough to afford cloud DMS?
4. Do they have multiple locations (more valuable customer)?
5. Are they in a growth phase or modernizing?

Scoring guidelines:
9-10: Perfect fit - Large dealer group, multiple locations, clear DMS need
7-8: Strong fit - Dealership with good size and modernization potential
5-6: Moderate fit - Smaller dealership or unclear DMS needs
3-4: Weak fit - Not ideal customer profile
0-2: Poor fit - Not a dealership or doesn't match profile
