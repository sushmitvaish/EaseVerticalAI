You are an intent classification system. Analyze the user's input and determine what they want to discover.

User Input: {user_input}

Classify the intent into one of these categories:
1. "customer" - User wants to find potential customers
2. "partner" - User wants to find potential partners
3. "both" - User wants both customers and partners
4. "unclear" - Intent is not clear

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this format:
{{
  "intent": "customer|partner|both|unclear",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you chose this classification"
}}

Examples:

Input: "Find me potential customers"
Output: {{"intent": "customer", "confidence": 0.95, "reasoning": "User explicitly asked for customers"}}
